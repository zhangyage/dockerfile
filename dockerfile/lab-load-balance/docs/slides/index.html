                ## HAProxy Overview
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## High availability
                * A function of system design allowing application to auto restart or reroute to another capable system in the event of a failure.
                   * A component can redirect the work
                   * A mechanism can monitor failure and transition the system when detects interruption.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## What is HAProxy?
                * HAProxy is an open source application used as TCP/HTTP Load Balancer and for proxy solutions.
                * It can distribute the workload across multiple server instances thus improving the overall performance and reliability.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## TCP vs. HTTP
                * In TCP layer(4) mode, HAProxy simply forwards bidirectional traffic between two sides.
                * In HTTP layer(7) mode, HAProxy analyzes the protocol, and can interact with it by allowing, blocking, switching, adding, modifying, or removing arbitrary contents in requests or responses, based on arbitrary criteria.

                ## HAProxy Installation
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## How to Install
                * Install by package manager
                * Install from source
                * Ensure your HAProxy version is >= 1.5 if need SSL access as SSL is natively supported since HAProxy 1.5.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## By Package Manager
                * For most modern Linux distributions, HAProxy can be easily installed from the default base repository using default package manager.

                ```shell
                RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, etc.
                # yum update
                # yum install haproxy

                Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
                # apt-get update
                # apt-get install haproxy
                    
                MacOS
                # brew install haproxy
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## From Source
                * See: https://github.com/docker-library/haproxy
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Validate
                * To ensure where the HAProxy is installed, run below command:

                ```shell
                # which haproxy
                /usr/sbin/haproxy
                ```
                * To ensure what the version of the installed HAProxy is, run below command:

                ```shell
                # haproxy -v
                HA-Proxy version 1.5.18 2016/05/10
                Copyright 2000-2016 Willy Tarreau &lt;willy@haproxy.org>
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Auto Start
                * Configure HAProxy as a service that can be auto started after reboot.
                * Enable but not activate. We will configure HAProxy before start it.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## By systemd
                * To ensure HAProxy service has functional systemd init script, check */etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/haproxy.service*
                * To enable the service, run below command:

                ```shell
                # systemctl enable haproxy.service
                ```
                * To reload systemd daemon and reflect the changes, run below command:

                ```shell
                # systemctl daemon-reload
                ```
                * To ensure the service has been enabled, check its status by running below command:
                
                ```shell
                # service haproxy status
                ```

                ## HAProxy Configuration
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Configuration Basics
                * *defaults* section sets default parameters for all other sections following its declaration.
                * *frontend* section describes a set of listening sockets accepting client connections.
                * *backend* section describes a set of servers to which the proxy will connect to forward incoming connections.
                * *listen* section defines a complete proxy with its frontend and backend parts combined in one section. It is generally useful for TCP-only traffic.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Backup haproxy.cfg
                * Backup the original sample configuration file at */etc/haproxy*:

                ```shell
                # cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg{,.old}
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enable Logging using UDP
                * For performance and maintenance reasons, HAProxy doesn't log directly to files. It logs against syslog server.
                * Open */etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg* to ensure the following line is defined under *global* section.

                ```
                log         127.0.0.1 local2
                ```
                * To enable UDP syslog reception in */etc/rsyslog.conf*, open *rsyslog.conf* and uncomment the following lines:

                ```
                # Provides UDP syslog reception
                $ModLoad imudp
                $UDPServerRun 514
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enable Logging using UDP
                * Create *haproxy.conf* under */etc/rsyslog.d/* and append the following line to the file:

                ```
                local2.*        /var/log/haproxy.log
                ```
                * To restart the rsyslog service and reflect the changes, run below command:

                ```shell
                # service rsyslog restart
                ```
                * To monitor the log for debugging purpose, run below command:
                
                ```shell
                # tail -f /var/log/haproxy.log
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enable Logging on Mac OS
                * For OS X 10.11+, you need to disable Apple System Integrity Protection(SIP) at first.
                  * Reboot into recovery mode (reboot and hold down Cmd-R)
                  * Open a terminal
                  * Run *csrutil disable*
                  * Reboot
                * It is highly recommended to re-enable SIP by running *csrutil enable* after you enable logging.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enable Logging on Mac OS
                * Change syslogd startup procedure to include its network listener.
                * Backup syslogd startup file:

                ```shell
                # cd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons
                # sudo cp com.apple.syslogd.plist{,.old}
                ```
                * Convert the file in binary format to xml to be human readable:

                ```shell
                # sudo plutil -convert xml1 com.apple.syslogd.plist
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enable Logging on Mac OS
                * Add the following snippet under *Sockets* node then save the file:

                ```xml
                &lt;key>NetworkListener&lt;/key>
                &lt;dict>
                  &lt;key>SockServiceName&lt;/key>
                  &lt;string>syslog&lt;/string>
                  &lt;key>SockType&lt;/key>
                  &lt;string>dgram&lt;/string>
                &lt;/dict>
                ```
                * Convert the file from xml back to binary, run below command:

                ```shell
                # sudo plutil -convert binary1 com.apple.syslogd.plist
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enable Logging on Mac OS
                * Restart syslogd to reflect the change, run below commands:

                ```shell
                # sudo launchctl unload com.apple.syslogd.plist
                # sudo launchctl load com.apple.syslogd.plist
                ```
                * Add the following entry to */etc/syslog.conf* for HAProxy logging:

                ```
                local2.* /var/log/haproxy.log
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enable stats
                * Add below *listen* section to enable the HAProxy statistic page:
                
                ```
                listen stats
                  bind 0.0.0.0:8090
                  mode http
                  stats enable
                  stats refresh 10s
                  stats show-node
                  stats auth haproxy:passw0rd
                  stats uri /haproxy/stats
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Simple Frontend and Backend
                * Configure an HTTP endpoint and bind to a certain port as frontend.
                * Configure backend servers with their IP addresses and ports
                * Use balance option to specifiy the balance algorithm, e.g. roundrobin

                ```
                frontend http-in
                  bind *:8080
                  default_backend app

                backend app
                  balance roundrobin
                  server  srv1 &lt;srv1_ip>:&lt;srv1_port>
                  server  srv2 &lt;srv2_ip>:&lt;srv2_port>
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enable SSL
                * SSL Termination
                  * To have HAProxy handle the SSL connection.
                  * To have the SSL Certificate live on HAProxy server.
                * SSL Pass-Through
                  * To have backend servers, rather than HAProxy, handle the SSL connection.
                  * HAProxy simply proxies request off to backend servers.
                  * Make the network transportation more efficient.
                  * But, HAProxy can't do anything with the request other than redirect it because the connection remains encrypted.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## SSL Pass-Through
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Defaults
                * Change the *mode* option from *http* to *tcp* in *defaults* section
                * Drop the settings that are only applicable to HTTP
                
                ```
                defaults
                  log             global
                  mode            tcp
                  option          tcplog
                  option          dontlognull
                  timeout connect 10s
                  timeout client  1m
                  timeout server  1m
                  timeout check   10s
                  maxconn         3000
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Frontend
                * For frontend, because HAProxy does not need to handle SSL, we just simply bind the port:
                * For backend, keep as is.

                ```
                frontend https-in
                  bind *:8443
                  default_backend app
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## SSL Termination
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Prepare Certs and Key
                * HAProxy uses a single file to hold private key, signed certificate, and any optionally intermediate CA certificates in *PEM* format.
                * If your private key has passphrase, HAProxy will prompt you for it on each start and stop, which is not suitable for a daemon. So, we remove the passphrase from the key.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Prepare Certs and Key
                * Use the *openssl rsa* command to remove the passphrase from the key file.

                ```shell
                # openssl rsa -in my.key -out my-no-pass.key
                ```
                * Concatenate the certificate and key files together (in that order) as below:

                ```shell
                # cat my.crt.pem my-no-pass.key | tee my-crt-key.pem
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Set Base Dir for Certs and Key
                * Add the base directories for your certs and key in *global* section as needed:

                ```c
                # Default SSL material locations
                ca-base /etc/ssl/certs
                crt-base /etc/ssl/private
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Frontend
                * Configure an HTTPS endpoint.
                * Use HTTPS(*ssl* directive) but not SSL 3.0(*no-sslv3* option) for security reason.
                * Use *crt* directive to specifiy where to find the certificate bundle.

                ```
                frontend https-in
                  bind *:8443     ssl no-sslv3 crt my-crt-key.pem
                  default_backend app
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Backend
                * If the backend servers have SSL enabled, you need certs and key to talk to them at backend:

                ```
                backend app
                  balance roundrobin
                  server srv1 &lt;srv1_ip>:&lt;srv1_port> ssl ca-file ca.pem crt my-crt-key.pem
                  server srv2 &lt;srv2_ip>:&lt;srv2_port> ssl ca-file ca.pem crt my-crt-key.pem
                ```
                * Otherwise, you don't have to configure ssl after server definitions.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Enforce SSL
                * If you want the site to be SSL-only, add *http-request redirect* to *frontend* section.
                * The *ssl_fc* condition indicates it will redirect from "http" to "https" if the front connection was not made with an SSL connection.

                ```
                frontend http-in
                  bind *:8080
                  http-request replace-value Host (.*):8080 \1:8443
                  http-request redirect scheme https if !{ ssl_fc }
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Health Check
                * To make sure the backend servers are healthy, configure HAProxy to check their health by periodically requesting a backend endpoint.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## General Settings
                * *check* option: Add after each server definition to enable health check on each server.
                * *log-health-checks* option: Enable health check logging.
                * *inter* parameter: Set the interval between two consecutive health checks.
                * *fall* parameter: Consider the server as dead after specified number of consecutive unsuccessful health checks.
                * *rise* parameter: Consider the server as operational after specified number of consecutive successful health checks.

                ```
                backend app
                  option  log-health-checks
                  server  srv1 &lt;srv1_ip>:&lt;srv1_port> check inter 10s fall 3 rise 2
                  server  srv2 &lt;srv2_ip>:&lt;srv2_port> check inter 10s fall 3 rise 2
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## TCP Check
                * Use *tcp-check* option to specify which TCP port on backend server will be used for health check

                ```
                backend app
                  balance roundrobin
                  option  tcp-check
                  option  log-health-checks
                  server  srv1 &lt;srv1_ip>:&lt;srv1_port> check port &lt;srv1_port2>
                  server  srv2 &lt;srv2_ip>:&lt;srv2_port> check port &lt;srv2_port2>
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## HTTP Check
                * Use *httpchk* option to specify what service endpoint will be used for health check
                * Use *ssl* directive with proper certificates for health check if backend servers are SSL enabled.

                ```
                backend app
                  balance roundrobin
                  option  httpchk GET /healthz
                  option  log-health-checks
                  server  srv1 &lt;srv1_ip>:&lt;srv1_port> check ssl ca-file ca.pem crt my-crt-key.pem
                  server  srv2 &lt;srv2_ip>:&lt;srv2_port> check ssl ca-file ca.pem crt my-crt-key.pem

                ## HAProxy Verification
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                * Let HAProxy validate the configuration file before we start:

                ```shell
                # haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -c
                ```
                * Start the HAProxy service if there is no validation error found:

                ```shell
                # service haproxy start
                ```
                * Monitor logs by checking haproxy.log after HAProxy is started:
                
                ```shell
                # tail -f /var/log/haproxy.log
                ```
                * You can also run HAProxy by disabling background mode to check logs in the same terminal right after it is started:

                ```shell
                # haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -db
                ```

                ## Keepalived Overview
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## What is Keepalived
                * A routing software written in C to provide simple and robust facilities for loadbalancing and high-availability to Linux based infrastructures
                * Rely on Linux Virtual Server(LVS) kernel module providing Layer4 loadbalancing.
                * Implement a set of checkers to dynamically maintain and manage loadbalanced server pool according their health.
                * Achieve high-availability by VRRP(Virtual Router Redundancy) protocol.
                * See: [LVS NAT + Keepalived HOWTO](http://www.keepalived.org/LVS-NAT-Keepalived-HOWTO.html)
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## HAProxy with Keepalived
                * To avoid the single point failure of HAProxy, multiple HAProxy instances can be configured in HA mode.
                * Two HAProxy nodes in active-passive mode can monitor each other using Keepalived.
                * Create a redundant pair of HAProxy servers by moving an IP address between HAProxy hosts.
                * Slave becomes master if master fails, and client will not notice any service disruption.

                ## Keepalived Installation
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## By Package Manager
                * For most modern Linux distributions, HAProxy can be easily installed from the default base repository using default package manager.

                ```shell
                RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, etc.
                # yum update
                # yum install keepalived

                Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
                # apt-get update
                # apt-get install keepalived
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Validate
                * To ensure where the Keepalived is installed, run below command:

                ```shell
                # which keepalived
                /usr/sbin/keepalived
                ```
                * To ensure what the version of the installed Keepalived is, run below command:

                ```shell
                # keepalived -v
                Keepalived v1.3.5 (03/19,2017), git commit v1.3.5-6-g6fa32f2

              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Auto Start
                * Configure Keepalived as a service that can be auto started after reboot.
                * Instructions are the same as HAProxy.

                ## Keepalived Configuration
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Configure Shared IP
                * Require multiple HAProxy nodes bound to a shared IP.
                * A virtual IP, instead of being assigned to local device.

                * To allow one HAProxy node assigned to the shared IP, add the following line to */etc/sysctl.conf*:

                ```
                net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1
                ```
                * To enable the change, run below command to load the configuration:

                ```shell
                # sysctl -p
                ```
                * Do not forget to configure on each machine installed both HAProxy and Keepalived.

              <section data-markdown>
                ## Backup keepalived.cfg
                * Backup the original sample configuration file at */etc/keepalived* if there is one:

                ```shell
                # cp /etc/keepalived/keepalived.cfg{,.old}
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Configure Master Node
                * Choose one machine as master node to configure.
                * Add below snippet to */etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf*:

                ```
                vrrp_instance VI_1 {
                  state MASTER
                  interface &lt;your_network_interface>
                  virtual_router_id 51
                  priority 101
                  advert_int 1
                  virtual_ipaddress {
                    &lt;your_virtual_ip>
                  }
                }
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Configure Master Node
                * *vrrp_instance* section defines VRRP behavior to run on a specific network interface. Each VRRP instance is related to a unique interface.
                * *interface* specifies the network interface to which the virtual IP is assigned. Can be different depending on system. To figure out the value, run below command:

                ```shell
                # ip addr show
                ```
                * *virtual_router_id* differentiate multiple instances of VRRP on the same NIC. Must be unique to each VRRP instance.
                * *priority* must be higher on master node than backup node.
                * *virtual_ipaddress* defines virtual ip shared among nodes.
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Configure Backup Node
                * Add below snippet to */etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf*:

                ```
                vrrp_instance VI_1 {
                  state BACKUP
                  interface &lt;your_network_interface>
                  virtual_router_id 51
                  priority 100
                  advert_int 1
                  virtual_ipaddress {
                    &lt;your_virtual_ip>
                  }
                }
                ```
                * The only difference with master node is the *state* and the *priority* to make it the passive, slave or hot-standby node.
              </section>

                ## Health Check
                * *vrrp_script* section defines script to check if HAProxy is running.
                * Use *killall* with sig 0 to check the existence of HAProxy process.
                * The positive weight means successes will add *weight* to the priority of all VRRP instances which monitor it.

                ```
                vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
                  script "killall -0 haproxy"
                  interval 2
                  weight 2
                }
                vrrp_instance VI_1 {
                  ...
                  track_script {
                    chk_haproxy
                  }
                }
                ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                ## Health Check
                * Other ways to check HAProxy health. For example:

                ```
                vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
                  script "pidof haproxy"
                  interval 2
                  weight 2
                }
                ```
                ```
                vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
                  script "pgrep haproxy"
                  interval 2
                  weight 2
                }
                ```

                ## Keepalived Verification
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                * Start the Keepalived service on both master and backup nodes:

                ```shell
                # service keepalived start
                ```
                * To check the virtual ip binding, run below command on both master and backup nodes:
                
                ```shell
                # ip addr sh &lt;your_network_interface>
                ```
                * Will see something similer to below snippet on master node meaning master node is listening on the shared IP.
                
                ```shell
                inet 172.18.0.6/32 scope global eth0
                   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
                ```

                * Monitor Keepalived logs by checking log file *syslog* or *messages* in */var/log*:

                ```shell
                # tail -f /var/log/syslog
                ```
